Prediction code is present in static.py. Run the static.py, it will ask input as "enter the path". Input here the full path of directory.
Make sure that code run on python2.It may show some error on python3. As i have written all code in python2.
Model is pickled and dumped that is present in sharadstatic.sav

I have used RandomForestClassifier, i have mentioned how i have trained model and do testing on the data given to me in this assignment.This code is present in modelsta.py
I have given this because of understanding of model.Please do not run this modelsta.py as it will give error because it doesn't contain list6 as it containes only model training code.

Lastly after completetion of static.py, static.csv will be seen in the same directory. If any of the error is occurred during compilation or the code is not running, You can inform me on sharad@iitk.ac.in.
As in my system all code runs perfectly and csv file is also generated.

Important Note:- Run static.py using python static.py(code is in python2).After this input will be asked. Mention there complete path of directory.
